# Sample of Work

## Image Compression Research Code
This folder contains work that I undertook as part of my research internship at the Swarm Intelligence Lab in the Institute of Aerospace Information Technology, Zhejiang University in September 2023. It consists of the encoder-decoder image compression model that I developed in Python. This work is currently in the process of being published under the working title: “FSIC: Frequency-separated Image Compression for Small Object Detection”.

This code requires the following packages: ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``torch``, ``scipy`` and ``geopy``. 

## Practical Statistics Courses
This folder contains an example of one of the coursework from my Practical Statistics Course I undertook in December 2022. This coursework explores regression and goodness-of-fit tests for insurance data using R.

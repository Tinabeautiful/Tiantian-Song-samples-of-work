# Sample of Work

## FSIC Frequency-separated Image Compression for Small Object Detection
This folder contains work that I undertook as part of my research internship at the Swarm Intelligence Lab in the Institute of Aerospace Information Technology, Zhejiang University from July to September 2023. It consists of the encoder-decoder image compression model that I developed in Python. This work is currently in the process of being published under the working title: “FSIC: Frequency-separated Image Compression for Small Object Detection”.

This code requires the following packages: ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``torch``, ``scipy`` and ``geopy``. 

## On-board Monocular Vision-based Ground Target Recognition and Localization System for a Flapping-wing Aerial Vehicle
This folder contains work that I undertook as part of my research internship at the Swarm Intelligence Lab in the Institute of Aerospace Information Technology, Zhejiang University from July to September 2023. It consists of the ground target localisation transformation that I developed in Python. This work has been published on "2023 4th International Conference on Computing, Networks and Internet of Things (CNIOT 2023)", and has been indexed by EI, under the working title: “On-board Monocular Vision-based Ground Target Recognition and Localization System for a Flapping-wing Aerial Vehicle”.

This code requires the following packages: ``numpy``, ``Rotation`` and ``geopy.distance``.

## Practical Statistics Coursework
This folder contains an example of one of the coursework from my Practical Statistics Course I undertook in December 2022. This coursework explores regression and goodness-of-fit tests for insurance data using R.

## Fox Chases Rabbit Project
This folder contains an example of one of the projects from my Problem Solving by Computer Course I undertook in November 2023. This project explores the dynamics between a fox and a rabbit by using differential equations modelling their positions with MATLAB.

## Tomographic Reconstruction
This folder contains work that I am currently doing as my undergraduate dissertation. It consists of the code of the plots of L2 Norms that I developed in Python.
